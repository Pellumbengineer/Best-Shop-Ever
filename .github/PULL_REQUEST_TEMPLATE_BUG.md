BUG
General
 I tested all changes and their related features with all corresponding user types on a test server.
 This is a small issue that I tested locally and was confirmed by another developer on a test server.
 Language: I followed the guidelines for inclusive, diversity-sensitive, and appreciative language.
 I chose a title conforming to the naming conventions for pull requests.
Server
 I followed the coding and design guidelines.
 I added multiple integration tests (Spring) related to the features (with a high test coverage).
 I added @PreAuthorize and checked the course groups for all new REST Calls (security).
 I implemented the changes with a good performance and prevented too many database calls.
 I documented the Java code using JavaDoc style.
Client
 I followed the coding and design guidelines and ensured that the layout is responsive.
 Following the theming guidelines, I specified colors only in the theming variable files and checked that the changes look consistent in both the light and the dark theme.
 I added multiple integration tests (Jest) related to the features (with a high test coverage), while following the test guidelines.
 I added authorities to all new routes and checked the course groups for displaying navigation elements (links, buttons).
 I documented the TypeScript code using JSDoc style.
 I added multiple screenshots/screencasts of my UI changes.
 I translated all newly inserted strings into English and German.
Changes affecting Programming Exercises
 I tested all changes and their related features with all corresponding user types on Test Server 1 (Atlassian Suite).
 I tested all changes and their related features with all corresponding user types on Test Server 2 (Jenkins and Gitlab).
